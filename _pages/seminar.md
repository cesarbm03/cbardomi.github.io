        * Abstract: Part II. We review first order theories and how to interpret them in a topos. We also define the syntactic topos.

    + Speaker: Daniel Almeida

        * Abstract: In this session we focus on discussing examples of some interesting (elementary) toposes, in particular presheaves topoi.

    + Speaker: Cesar Bardomiano

        * Abstract: We finish the proof that an elementary topos is finitely cocomplete. We also prove the fundamental
            theorem of topos theory.

    + Speaker: Cesar Bardomiano

        * Abstract: We introduce the definition of an elementary topos and give the tools to prove that an elementary
            topos has all finite limits.
