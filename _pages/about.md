I am a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/fr">University of Ottawa</a> under the supervision of 
<a href="http://www.normalesup.org/~henry/">Simon Henry</a>. My research interest revolve around the following topics:
 <ul>
  <li>Higher categories</li>
  <li>Synthetic higher category theory </li>
  <li>Theory of model categories</li>
  <li>Homotopy type theory (and its variations)</li>
</ul> 
I collaborate in a formalization project of synthetic âˆž-categories. We work with the computer proof assistant <a href="https://github.com/rzk-lang/rzk">rzk</a> developed by <a href="https://fizruk.github.io/">Nikolai Kudazov</a>.
